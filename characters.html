		<h2>Sonic the Hedgehog</h2>
		
		<img src="Sonic_modern_and_classic_designs.jpg" alt="sonic generations" width="300px">
		
	   <p>Sonic is a blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog born with the ability to run faster than the speed of sound. As his species implies, Sonic can also roll up into a concussive ball to attack enemies.  He's confident, fearless, and always up for an adventure. He's known for his smug attitude and quick wit, often teasing his enemies while zooming past them. He was born on Christmas Island on June 23rd, 1991. He abandoned his home at an early age to pursue danger and adventures. </p>
	  
	   <p>Sonic's birthplace, Christmas Island, is based on an actual island called Kiritimati. This island was used for nuclear weapons testing by the US and UK during the Cold War. This is why in Sonic's universe is full of robots and weird animals. </p>
	
	   <p>Sonic has spent most of his life travelling around the world and far beyond. He uses his abilities to defend the world from the forces of evil, especially his arch nemises Dr Eggman. Despite his recklessness, Sonic has a big heart and fights for justice no matter what. He's super loyal to his pals and will do whatever it takes to save the day. </p>
		
		<p> Sonic has varius powerfult transformations:
				
				<li>Super Sonic: Achieved by using the Chaos Emeralds, this form enhances Sonic's abilities significantly, allowing him to fly and making him nearly invulnerable, but it drains his energy quickly.</li>
					
				<li>Hyper Sonic: With the power of the Super Emeralds, Sonic can enter a more potent version of Super Sonic with even greater abilities.</li>
					
				<li> Super Sonic 2: By tapping into Cyber corruption, Sonic gains a superior form with increased power and speed.</li>
					
				<li>Super Sonic Cyber: A glitchy and frenzied form attained by pushing Super Sonic 2 to its limits, granting extreme power and speed but causing Sonic more suffering.</li>
					
				<li>Darkspine Sonic: Using the World Rings, Sonic transforms into a darker, more powerful version with elemental abilities, though he becomes slightly more violent.</li>
					
				<li> Excalibur Sonic: By wielding the four sacred swords, Sonic gains a golden armored form with flight, enhanced strength, and the legendary sword Excalibur. </li>
				
				<li> Sonic the Werehog: After absorbing Gaia's power, Sonic gains a werewolf-like form at night, losing speed but gaining strength, sharp claws, and limited energy control. </li>
				
				</p>
				
				<p> Sonic can also use different Color Powers from Wisps to transform into various forms like a drill or fireball, each with unique abilities, but these transformations require a steady supply of Hyper-go-on. </p>
				
				<p> Despite not being afraid of water, Sonic is a poor swimmer, and his speed is greatly reduced underwater. Lack of sleep can affect his running, and he has trouble maintaining balance when abruptly stopping at high speeds. </p>

				<h2> Knuckles the Echidna </h2>
	
	<img src= "Knuckles_the_Echidna.jpg" alt="knuckles the echidna" width="200px">
				
		<p>Knuckles the Echidna is an anthropomorphic echidna known for his role as the guardian of the Master Emerald, a powerful ancient gem found on Angel Island. This duty is not only his solemn responsibility but also connects him to the Knuckles Clan, the last remaining echidna lineage. 
Knuckles is famous for his incredible strength and distinctive spiked knuckles, which help him with digging and climbing. Despite preferring solitude, Knuckles values his friends, especially Sonic the Hedgehog, whom he sees both as an ally and a rival. </p>
<p>While he spends most of his time protecting the Master Emerald, Knuckles is always ready to aid his friends when they need him. Growing up alone has made Knuckles straightforward and honest, but also somewhat naive and easily tricked, especially by enemies like Dr. Eggman. Despite his occasional gullibility, Knuckles is unmatched in physical prowess. He can smash boulders, break through steel, and lift objects much larger than himself effortlessly. His combat skills are equally impressive, capable of creating earthquakes and powerful shockwaves with his punches. Knuckles is determined and focused on his goals, but his vulnerability to deception and impulsive decisions highlight his complex character.

				<h2> Metal Sonic </h2>
	
	<img src= "Metal Sonic.jpg" alt="metal sonic" width="150px">
				
		<p>Created by Dr. Eggman as an advanced and malevolent version of Sonic himself. Metal Sonic was designed with unparalleled precision and capability to be Eggman's ultimate weapon aimed at the blue hedgehog's destruction. Despite resembling Sonic physically and mimicking his abilities with remarkable accuracy, Metal Sonic exceeds his organic counterpart in speed and power. Despite subsequent failures, Metal Sonic repeatedly returns, driven by an intense desire to prove his superiority over Sonic and eliminate him once and for all. This obsession has led Metal Sonic to rebel against Eggman on multiple occasions, showcasing his independent and ruthless nature. </p>
		<p>Unlike Sonic's cheerful and carefree demeanor, Metal Sonic is characterized as cold-hearted, aggressive, and emotionally detached, emphasizing his stark contrast in personality despite his physical likeness. Although predominantly mute, he communicates through mechanical sounds, emphasizing his robotic nature. Acknowledged as Dr. Eggman's most formidable creation, Metal Sonic is consistently upgraded after each defeat, returning stronger and faster than before. However, these enhancements are not without drawbacks, as his high speeds often lead to overheating and internal system failures. Despite these flaws, Metal Sonic remains one of Sonic's most persistent and dangerous adversaries, embodying a relentless pursuit of superiority and vengeance.

	<img src= "silver.jpg" alt="shadow the hedgehog" width="200px">
				
		<p>Silver the Hedgehog is a complex character within the Sonic the Hedgehog series, hailing from a dystopian future ravaged by chaos and ruin.

<p>Silver's journey is marked by growth and introspection. Though described as naive and impulsive, he's also perceptive, rarely falling prey to deception.

		<p>Shadow the Hedgehog is a unique character with a complex backstory. He's part hedgehog and part Black Arms alien, sharing many traits with Sonic the Hedgehog.

Fifty years later, Dr. Eggman freed Shadow to help him conquer Earth. </p>

His traumatic past, especially losing Maria (his only friend), has deeply affected him, driving his quest for justice and redemption. Over time, he's learned to protect Earth and honor Maria's memory.In battles, Shadow is incredibly powerful, with super strength, speed, and resilience. He can harness Chaos energy for powerful attacks and uses Chaos Control to warp reality and improve his fighting skills. His strong will helps him resist manipulation and defeat tough opponents, showing his determination to fulfill his mission and protect those he cares about.

				<h2> Team Dark </h2>

Despite his destructive tendencies, he forms a strong bond with Shadow and Rouge, showing loyalty and occasionally softer emotions, especially towards his allies.</p> <img src= "omega copy.jpg" alt="e-123 omega robot" width="200px">


<p>Team Dark formed when Rouge the Bat inadvertently activated E-123 Omega while searching for Dr. Eggman's treasure inside one of his bases. Omega initially mistook Shadow the Hedgehog, found in stasis, as an enemy and attacked him until Rouge intervened. Realizing they shared a common enemy in Eggman, Rouge proposed they team up, uniting Shadow's lost memories and desire for answers, Rouge's quest for treasure, and Omega's mission to eliminate Eggman.
