				<h2>Lets get you started</h2>
				<p> In Sonic's world, which is like a cooler version of Earth, there are talking animals living on special islands. These islands hide powerful gems called Chaos Emeralds and one super-important Master Emerald. And everywhere you go, you'll find Golden Rings, which aren't as strong but are still super important. </p>
				
				<p>Due to consistency issues within the early games, there's currently two sonic timelines. These two timelines are the "Classic" and the "Modern", but there's even more complicated lore. </p>

                <p>The Classic Sonic timeline is set in a simple world. It has islands and zones, such as South Island, Westside Island, and Angel Island.  The lore is straightforward, focusing on Sonic's battles against Dr. Robotnik, who captures animals to power his robots. Key elements include the Chaos Emeralds, and the introduction of characters like Tails, Knuckles, and Amy.</p>

                <p>The Modern Sonic timeline has a lots of settings. From realistic cities like Station Square to ancient ruins and otherworldly dimensions. The environments are detailed, advanced graphics, blending realistic textures with fantastical elements. The lore is more complex, exploring mature themes such as heroism, friendship, and existential threats. Characters are more complicated too, with new additions like Shadow, Rouge, and Silver. Dr. Eggman has more elaborate schemes. This timeline incorporates elements like time travel and alternate dimensions.</p>
